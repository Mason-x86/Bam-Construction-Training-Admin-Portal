# Bam-Construction-Training-Admin-Portal
Since the original source code is owned by the company, this repository includes only non‑sensitive assets: UI images, high‑level system details, and summaries of key features. The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my skills in full‑stack development, problem‑solving, and building real-world production systems.

# Internal Application Overview (Portfolio Documentation)

This repository showcases an internal production application I designed and developed for my company.  
Because the project contains proprietary logic and business data, the source code is **not** included.  
Instead, this repository provides high-level documentation, screenshots, architectural notes, and a
breakdown of the features and contributions I made to the project.

## Project Summary

This application was built to streamline internal business workflows, automate manual processes, and
provide a centralized platform for managing operational data. The system is used daily by staff and
administrators and integrates scheduling, candidate management, booking flows, reporting, and
internal support tools.

My responsibilities included end‑to‑end development — covering backend API design, database work,
frontend UI/UX, authentication flows, and integration with external services.

## Key Features

- ✓ Custom scheduling calendar with drag‑and‑drop course management  
- ✓ Candidate and client management with encrypted data handling  
- ✓ Complex booking workflows for CPCS, CITB, NVQ, Events, and in‑house courses  
- ✓ Automated joining instructions and document generation (PDF)  
- ✓ Dashboard and reporting tools  
- ✓ Role‑based authentication with admin permission controls  
- ✓ Integration with external services (e.g., email providers, invoicing APIs)  
- ✓ Scalable backend built with service‑layer architecture and detailed logging

## Tech Stack (High‑Level)

**Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, React Router, Redux  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MSSQL  
**Auth:** Token-based authentication, refresh token rotation  
**Other:** Xero API, PDF generation, encryption utilities, internal auditing/logging

(Technologies shown here are intentionally high-level and non-sensitive.)

## System Architecture (High-Level)

The following documentation provides safe, high‑level insights into the system design:

- `/docs/architecture.md` – overview of services, request flow, and component responsibilities  
- `/docs/data-flow.md` – sanitized diagrams describing major internal workflows  
- `/docs/features.md` – detailed breakdown of the major modules and how they work  
- `/docs/tech-decisions.md` – key design decisions and tradeoffs made during development  

These files describe concepts only — no confidential queries, schemas, or company specifics.

## My Contributions

- Designed and implemented core backend services and API endpoints  
- Built complex frontend UI components (e.g., TrainersWeeklyCalendar, Course modals, Booking system)  
- Created encryption indexing strategy for secure searching of sensitive data  
- Designed and optimized multiple MSSQL query patterns and stored actions  
- Implemented comprehensive logging, telemetry, and auditing patterns  
- Architected robust auth flow with rotating refresh tokens and centralized user handling
